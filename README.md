<h1>2DAW PROJECT WITH GO, LARAVEL AND ANGULAR</h1>

This web page works with 2 backends (Go and Laravel) and the frontend (Angular11).  
Poject developed by *Marc Torres Mart√≠nez*.
<br>
With this project I was trying to do a page where a community of persons can share their own recipes, follow people, favorite other recipes, etc; and at the same time a shop, so users can buy the meals/tuppers that it offers.
---

## Getting started

If you want to run this repository locally:

- Clone this repository to a folder
- Install mySQL and run it. Also create the database that you are going to use for the application.
- Search for the files with database connections, redis, etc, and change them.
- Install angular packages, and go and laravel dependences (npm install, go get, etc). Also migrate laravel tables with php artisan migrate.
- Now you can execute the frontend with **npm start**, the go backend with **go run main.go** inside each microservice, and laravel with **php artisan serve**.

You can also run the application in docker:
 - sudo docker-compose up --build

## Backend Application Structure

- `go` - There are features up to all the users: see recipes, see profiles, follow user(if logged), favorite recipe(if logged), create recipe(if logged), login, register.
- `laravel` - There are features related to things that the admins can controll: create catgory (only admin), create meal (only admin), show carousel, show meals.

## Frontend Application Structure

- `angular` - The frontend works with angular and has some features like the AuthGuard or AdminGuard so you cannot access some routes that require it. You store two bearers, one from Go to know that you are logged in, and the other from Laravel to know that you are an admin.dule.
